# Symlink-Creator
**Very simple Command Prompt UI to create symlinks quick and easy.**

## HOW TO LAUNCH UI FROM ANY COMMAND PROMPT WINDOW: 
### *(Recommended)*  

- Open your Documents folder  

- Create a folder called Scripts  

- Place the Symlink.bat file into the Scripts folder you made

- Windows search for Environment Variables

- Once the System Properties window opens, select Environment Variables

- Under User Variables, select Path and then Edit

- Click New to add a new path to your User Variables

- Paste the path of your Scripts folder you made — it should look like:
   C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Scripts

- Press OK > OK > OK to close Environment Variables

- Open a Command Prompt window and type:
  Symlink

This will display the creator mini UI whenever you want it :)
